# QuantumTester
Python app to test tracking accuracy with different Win32PrioritySeparation values. Take with a heap of salt as the app was made for fun and is non-scientific.

## Installation
* Install a recent version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Install requirements with `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
* Run `main.py` **as administrator** (for registry access)
* Track the ball. The app will switch between different Win32PrioritySeparation values and report your accuracy for each
